#  MERN Stack Learning Journey

## Journey
I started my MERN Stack learning journey with the goal of becoming a full-stack web developer.  
This journey begins from understanding basic web technologies and gradually moves toward building complete, real-world full-stack applications.

I followed a structured, phase-wise approach to learn both *frontend and backend development*, focusing on writing clean code, understanding concepts clearly, and practicing regularly through small tasks and projects.
